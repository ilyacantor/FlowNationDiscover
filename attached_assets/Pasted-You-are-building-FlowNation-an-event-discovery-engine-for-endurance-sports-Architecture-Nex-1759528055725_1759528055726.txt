You are building FlowNation, an event discovery engine for endurance sports.

Architecture:
- Next.js (Pages Router)
- Tailwind CSS (already configured)
- Components under /components
- API routes under /pages/api

Design / Look & Feel:
- Clean, professional style similar to BikeReg.com
- Palette: navy blue (#003366), white, light gray (#f9fafb), accent blue (#2563eb)
- Typography: Sans-serif, semi-bold headers, medium body
- Rounded corners (rounded-lg), subtle shadows (shadow-md), hover elevation
- Responsive: 
  • Desktop = 4-column grid (events area + sidebar) 
  • Mobile = 1-column stacked

Core UI Components:
1. NavBar
   - White background, subtle shadow
   - Links: Home, Events, Match, Calendar, Other
   - Hover state = text turns navy
   - Active link = bold + underline

2. Filter Bar (Events Page)
   - White rounded container with shadow
   - Inside: pill-style input boxes (Event Date, Event Location, Event Type, Distance, Event Name)
   - Reset (gray text) + Apply (navy button, white text) aligned right
   - Responsive: horizontal row on desktop, stacked on mobile

3. Event Results
   - Header row: “XXX results” (left) + “My location: ZIP” (right)
   - Grouped by month with a navy header bar
   - Each event row:
     • Left side: title (blue link, bold), location (gray), tags (pills)
     • Right side: sponsor/team logo
   - Hover = row background turns light gray

4. Featured Events
   - Section header: “Featured Events”
   - Horizontal scrollable carousel (cards ~280px wide)
   - Each card:
     • Image (top)
     • Event type badge (top-left overlay)
     • Title, date, location below
   - Scrollbar hidden, swipeable on mobile

5. Sidebar (optional, future)
   - Promotional card (e.g. “Outside+ Free Trial”) with bright background

Data Schema:
{
  id, title, type, date, location, distance,
  tags: [], source, url, image, logo
}

Behavior:
- API `/api/events` returns mock events
- Events page fetches from API and renders UI
- Test pages (/test/match, /test/calendar, /test/other) are placeholders
